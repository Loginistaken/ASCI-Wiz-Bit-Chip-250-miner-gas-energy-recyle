This project redesigns an Antminer to use a high-density array of 250 ASIC chips (arranged in 10 rows), with a focus on maximizing energy efficiency. The build integrates advanced energy recycling (heat, vibration, airflow, IR, EM) and uses optimized materials and smart control logic to target at least 20% net energy savings.
1. System Architecture

    Processing Core:
        10 rows of 25 ASIC chips each (total: 250 ASIC chips).
        All energy management and recycling elements are designed specifically for the thermal/electrical behavior of ASICs.

    Energy Saving Focus:
        Heat, airflow, vibration, IR, and EM energy are harvested or recycled.
        Smart system logic routes and buffers recycled energy.
