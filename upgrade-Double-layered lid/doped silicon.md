🧱 1. Structural Overview: Chimney Lid as Energy Harvester
Lid Composition
Layer	Material	Function
Outer Shell	Doped Silicon (Boron + Phosphorus + Germanium alloy)	High thermal conductivity, robust surface for IR and heat capture
Inner Mesh	Graphene Mesh (pristine base, nitrogen-doped zones)	High EM conductivity, IR response, embedded nano-silver for plasmonic enhancement
Between Layers	Photonic Bandgap Layer	Converts IR to usable PV-band energy, boosts collection from thermal radiation
Frame Gasket	Silicone (non-conductive, high-temp)	Ensures insulation and thermal airflow isolation

🕹️ 2. Manual Lever + Circuit Disconnect Mechanism
Lever Function:
Primary movement: Vertical lift or tilt using a high-temp ceramic-coated manual lever

Action result:

Opens vent (chimney airflow enabled)

Slides a cam gear or toggles a snap-action switch to break circuit path

Triggers a reed switch to send "LID OPEN" status to the AI Controller Hub

Circuit Disconnect Components:
Component	Purpose
🔌 Gold-plated Spring Contacts	Maintains a low-resistance bridge between graphene mesh & logic while lid is closed
⚙️ Snap-action Switch	Instantly breaks circuit when lever is pulled past a defined threshold
🧲 Magnetic Reed Switch (Optional)	Sends state signal to AI controller (open/closed lid logic routing)

⚛️ 3. Optimized Material & Doping Choices
Silicon Doping (Outer Layer):
Boron (p-type) → Enables positive hole carriers for TE effect and IR conductivity

Phosphorus (n-type) → Electron donor for enhanced conductivity

Germanium Alloying → Increases temperature sensitivity and IR response

Graphene Mesh:
Base Layer: Pristine graphene for conductivity and EM harvesting

Localized Nitrogen Doping: Improves active sites for charge mobility

Nano-Silver Particles: Amplify IR absorption via localized surface plasmon resonance

Energy Output Potential (per vent lid):
Source	Output (approx.)
TEG Harvesting	2–4W
IR/Photonic Bandgap Layer	1–3W
EM/Graphene + Plasmonics	2–5W
Total per lid (peak)	5–12W recycled

🛡️ 5. Safety & Maintenance Integration
Lid can be safely opened at runtime without circuit risk.

Snap-action and reed switch prevent feedback surges.

Energy routing logic detects disconnect and auto-reroutes.

AI Hub can notify user or auto-disable energy harvesting from this lid while open.
