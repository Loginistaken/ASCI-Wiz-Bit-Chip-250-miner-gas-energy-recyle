# END OF MODULE
# =============================

Key improvements:

    Clear separation of firmware, Python AI, FastAPI backend, and signature verification.
    Detailed comments and docstrings for all functions.
    Error handling for serial, file, and request failures.
    Security best practices (use .env, HTTPS, authentication suggested).
    Threaded AI main loop for scalability.
    Ready for modularization into separate files.

This file is a multi-part template and pseudo-code document for a complete energy measurement, reporting, and compliance system. It covers:

    Firmware (C/pseudocode) for embedded hardware (microcontrollers like STM32, ESP32, or RP2040) to collect and report energy readings over serial.
    Python host-side logic to interface with the device, parse real-time data, make AI-based routing decisions, and handle compliance uploads.
    Backend (FastAPI, Python) for a compliance web portal that verifies device submissions.
    Frontend (React) for device connection and compliance file upload.
    Suggested Database Schema for system logs.
    Advanced AI Optimization Routine (Python, rule-based, but extensible to ML).

Each section is presented as a code snippet or template, meant to be split into individual files/modules in a production project.
1. Firmware (Embedded C / Pseudocode)

Purpose:
Runs on hardware to monitor four energy channelsâ€”Photonic, IR, EM (electromagnetic), and TEG (thermoelectric generator).
Key Features:

    Measures voltage, current, and temperature on each channel.
    Reports data over USB Serial to a host.
    Accepts basic control commands.

Highlights:

    Data structure: ChannelStatus holds voltage, current, and temperature for each channel.
    Function sample_channels() simulates ADC readings.
    Function report_status() outputs all channel readings in a parseable format.
    Serial handler can accept commands like GET_DEVICE_ID.
    Main loop samples, reports, listens for commands, and repeats in a timed loop.

2. Host AI/CPU Logic (Python)

Purpose:
A Python script that connects to the device via serial, parses real-time channel data, makes AI-based decisions, and manages compliance uploads.

Key Features:

    Serial communication setup (serial.Serial).
    Parses device output such as ENERGY_STATUS:PHOTON=...;IR=...;....
    Can send commands back to device, e.g., to reroute energy, buffer a channel, etc.
    Uploads compliance files to a backend server.
    Contains a placeholder for AI/optimization logic.

Highlights:

    parse_status(line): Parses device output into a Python dictionary for further processing.
    send_command(cmd): Sends control commands to the device.
    upload_compliance(): Uploads compliance PDF and signature to the backend via HTTP.
    Main loop receives serial data, parses, logs, and (optionally) triggers compliance upload.

3. Backend (FastAPI, Python) - Compliance Portal

Purpose:
A backend server that receives compliance uploads from the host, verifies digital signatures, and exposes an API for the frontend.

Key Features:

    FastAPI is used for the web server.
    CORS middleware enabled for compatibility with the React frontend.
    API endpoint /api/verify accepts device ID, PDF, and signature as file uploads.
    Uses a helper in verify_signature.py to check the uploaded PDF against a signature and public key.
    Dependencies: fastapi, uvicorn, cryptography, python-multipart.

Highlights:

    Security: Uses cryptographic signature checking to verify authenticity of the compliance PDFs.
    Returns "Compliant" or "Not Compliant" based on verification result.

4. Frontend (React) - Compliance Portal UI

Purpose:
A simple React SPA for users to connect a device, upload compliance data, and see status.

Components:

    App.jsx: Main layout; coordinates device connection, compliance upload, and status display.
    DeviceConnect.jsx: Uses Web Serial API to connect to the hardware and fetch the device ID.
    UploadCompliance.jsx: Allows user to upload a PDF and signature file, sends them to the backend for verification.
    StatusBanner.jsx: Shows compliance status (compliant/not compliant) visually.

5. Database Schema (SQL, Example for PostgreSQL)

Purpose:
Defines tables for logging all relevant data for analytics, auditing, and compliance.

Tables:

    devices: Registered devices.
    energy_logs: Raw channel measurements.
    ai_decisions: Each AI/routing decision, with before/after state.
    compliance_events: Compliance-related events per device.

Highlights:

    Designed for time-series queries, auditing, and optimization tracking.
    Easily extensible for additional fields (e.g., firmware version, device health).

6. Advanced AI Optimization (Python Example)

Purpose:
Outlines how to implement smart, automated routing of energy channels using either rule-based or ML-based logic.

Rule-based Example:

    Prioritize channels with highest voltage/current.
    Reduce load on overheating channels.
    Default to load balancing.

ML Suggestion:

    Train a model on historical data for smarter routing.

General Improvements, Error Handling, and Security (as per prior recommendations):

    Separation of concerns: Each major function (firmware, host AI, backend, frontend) is a clear, independent module.
    Commenting: Each function and snippet contains comments explaining intent, input/output, and error handling.
    Error handling: Suggestions for catching sensor/ADC errors, serial disconnects, file upload problems, and signature verification failures.
    Optimization: Suggestions for using DMA/interrupts, threading/async in Python, and database indexing.
    Security: Use of environment variables for credentials, recommendation for HTTPS, input validation, and cryptographic verification.
    Testing: Guidance to add unit tests for parsing, command sending, and verification logic.

How to Use or Expand

    Developers building a similar system can use these templates as a starting point for each layer (firmware, host, backend, frontend, database).
    Split code into real files: Each major section should be its own .c, .py, .jsx, or .sql file for maintainability.
    Add production features: Authentication, robust error handling, real-time dashboards, and more advanced analytics.
